# The Project 
> The project consists in a first look into Sockets, and for that we've created a chat-based game of 21.
## The Game
> In every match the players will start off with no cards, and as the game begins a deck with 52 different cards will be generated, allowing each one of them to decide whether to pick or not a card once is their turn, summing up as many as they want until the end of the match
>> A match will end once all the players deny to pick a card in their turns, leading to the summing up of everyone's cards to decide the winner.
>>The winner is decided by the one who achieves a sum of 21 or the closest, but never higher. 
> Once the match is over the players can restart another match with no problems.
## The Working
> For the game to occur a Server is started, allowing players to log in and connect to a chat, being able to choose their usernames, distincted by a random color. 
> Once all the players in the chat type the key-word "/start" a new match starts, in which the players can still send messages and chat regularly, with the difference now that new special messages are allowed for the working of the match.
>> By typing "/help" the players have access to the list of special messages for consulting.
